Grid-DRI is an ImageJ macro that facilitates the process of counting the petrographic features for
determining the Damage Rating Index (DRI). Grid-DRI requires a high resolution image of the polished
slab prepared for analysis. Grid-DRI works by point-counting principles: user input of observed features
is required for each 1cm^2 frame.

In its present form, the Damage Rating Index (as a formal methodology) is
performed directly on a polished slab using a zoom stereo microscope at a magnification of 16x.
Alternatively, Grid-DRI can be used in instances where direct access to the polished slab is not possible,
but access to a high resolution image of the polished slab is available. For instance, a flatbed scanner or
digital microscope could be used to record an image of the entire polished slab, and the image analyzed
using Grid-DRI. By default the petrographic features and their weighting factors are set to the proposed
values by Sanchez et al. (2015), but can be modified as necessary within the macro by the user.
